[170402]

Notes:
Groups at KEIL are not subdirs in the project.
You have to define it twice, as a subdir, and then under KEIL as a group.

1.
Move the Drivers folders from FW_L0 library into gps_logger project.
What about uC registers .h file ?
Also the group Drivers/CMSIS contains only one file located at ./sys.
Move it to gps_logger/Drivers/CMSIS, what about other files from CMSIS ?
Really see and repeat/modify compiler control string to correctly update
all -I and -l when moving it into project subdir.

But... maybe do not do it ?
Because if library is outside of the project this is easy to update it ?

2.
Move all things after finish project structure into git repo.
If compilable.
